# Boston-Housing-Project
Linear Regression Project

This is Boston's house price predicting project, where we are going to build the model to predict the value of houses
in Boston. Model is trained with the past data so that it can predict the future price, just by entering the specific parameters. Which would be helpful for a real estate agent daily.

    1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
                 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
                 river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
                 by town
    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
    
    
So our aim in this project is to find the features on which the Boston housing price depends.
Then using those features we are going to train the model so that in future, using those feature we can predict the price in Boston. 
Before that, we must to preprocess the data and remove the outliers from the data but data we have taken does not need to be preprocessed.
